            <h2 class="adjust-me">Gameplay</h2>

            <p>
                The Mercenary is a Life you can choose in the game Fantasy Life. It is one of 12 Lives that can be
                chosen at any time during the game by visiting the Guild Master (except during a story mission).

                The Mercenary uses greatswords to inflict great damage to enemies in close combat. As it is two-handed
                the player can not use a shield while wielding a greatsword. Greatswords are the weapons with the
                highest damage in the game but with a slower attack speed.
            </p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>

            <p>
                When the player chooses the Mercenary life, they learn 1 skill: Greatsword. The max skill level is 15
                (20 with the DLC). To unlock the new cap, you must reach Legend rank and talk to Divinus with the
                Mercenary Life activated. He will increase the cap of this skill to 20 and upgrade the licence to
                God-in-Training rank.
            </p>

            <h2>Abilities</h2>

                When reaching God/Creator rank with Mercenary, the player gains the ability "Berserker" which can be
                activated when the player has a double charged Skill Gauge. When activated, Berserker gives a x2 buff to
                damage dealt and constantly refills the player's Skill Gauge for one minute.
