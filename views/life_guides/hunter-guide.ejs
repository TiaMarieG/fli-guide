            <p>
                The Hunter is a Life you can choose in the game Fantasy Life. It is one of 12 Lives that can be chosen
                at
                any time during the game by visiting the Guild Master (except during a story mission).

                Hunters use bows to inflict damage and status effects (poison, sleep and paralysis) on enemies from a
                safe distance.
