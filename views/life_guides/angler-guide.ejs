            <p>
                The Angler is a Life you can choose in the game Fantasy Life. It is one of 14 Lives that can be chosen
                at any time during the game by visiting the Guild Master (except during a story mission).
            </p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>

            <p>
                When the player chooses the Angler life, they learn 1 skill: Fishing. The max skill level is 15 (20 with
                the DLC). To unlock the new cap, you must reach Legend rank and talk to Divinus with the Angler Life
                activated. He will increase the cap of this skill to 20 and upgrade the licence to God-in-Training rank.
            </p>

            <h2>Equipment</h2>

            <p>
                The Angler uses fishing rods to catch fish around Reveria.
