# FLi Guide - An online helper tool for the upcoming game Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals

## A Quick Rundown

This project was started before the final was announced as it's a personal project of mine that I've been slowly working on over the past few weeks. After learning of the final and what would be needed for it, I realized that my personal project would be a good fit as some of the requirements were tasks that I was going to implement at some point in the future anyway. They'd just be done sooner rather than later now.

The goal of this personal project is to create a main source of information that players of the game 'Fantasy Life i' can quickly access without having to switch between multiple different sites or spend time scouring through social media platforms in hopes of finding answers to niche questions. As a gamer myself, it can be frustrating trying to figure out certain aspects of a game and asking for help can be daunting, especially when one is uncertain as to how others will react to a request for aid. As such, it's my goal for this website to grow and adapt to be supportive in all aspects of the game.

Fantasy Life i is not set to release until April 2025, so much of the data that's seen on this guide was pulled from its predecessor - Fantasy Life. Once Fantasy Life i has gone live, all information will be updated.

CSS - Many of the images were pulled from the Fli Home website. The color scheme is intended to match the theme of Fli. Each 'life' icon was snipped from the main page and the background removed so that it could be used as part of the links on the main page.

Life Skills - I opted to work on the Blacksmith, Carpenter, and Cook lives. The data for each life was pulled from the Fantasy Life Wiki page. The 'recipes' that can be selected were made up and don't actually exist in-game, but they match the theme of the chosen life.

*NOTE* - The reason that the combat and gathering skills were not chosen to be worked on for this assignment is because they do not currently possess information that would need to be incorporated into a database. This may change in the future once the game goes live and I see what changes from the base game, Fantasy Life, have been implemented, but as of right now, they will remain blank. THESE SKILLS WILL HAVE RELEVANT INFORMATION EVENTUALLY. They just weren't needed for the intentions of this final project.

Database - The database has gone through several iterations as both Tav and I have worked on it. At first, there was going to be two tables for every skill - one for recipes stored on the database and one that contains recipes that users submitted for review - but we decided that that was going to be way too many tables to try and manage. Things could get messy quickly. Tav came up with the idea that we have two overall tables - one for stored recipes and one for submitted recipes - and there would be a column that would have what skill this recipe was tied to. This would make it easier to manage the recipes as well as quickly sort them for review rather than having to bounce between potentially 28 different tables.
